# Project: PWM using the Atmega324p Microcontroller

## The aim
The aim of this project is to show how to use the hardware pulse width modulation pins on the Atmega324p microcontroller to control the frequency and duty cycle of a PWM signal.

## Simulation of PWM signal using Proteus Simulation Software

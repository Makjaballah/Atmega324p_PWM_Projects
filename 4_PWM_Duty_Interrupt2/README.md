# Project: Generation of PWM signal by using two timers with the Atmega324p microcontroller

## The aim
The main object of this application is to show how to generate PWM signal by using two timers with the Atmega324p microcontroller. Timers/Counter1 is used to control the frequency of the PWM signal. Timer/Counter0 is used to control the duty cycle of the PWM signal.

## Simulation of the PWM signal using Proteus Simulation Software

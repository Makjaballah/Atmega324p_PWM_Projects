# Project: Generation of PWM signal using the Timer/Counter1 and Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) with the Atmega324p microcontroller

## The aim
The aim of this project is to show how to generate PWM signal by using the Timer/Counter1 and Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) with the Atmega324p microcontroller.

## Simulation of the PWM signal using Proteus Simulation Software
